first you need angular CLI - https://cli.angular.io/ install it,
angular have the instructions on page, you can use npm or bower what ever you want or need. 
I use npm so, using NPM in the command line write: npm install -g angular/cli@latest

then using angular CLI you can visualize the project, just go to the 
project root and write ng serve -o.

Note: You need nodejs install in your computer or laptop for everything wroks correctly.. first before you
install angular, check if you got nodejs https://nodejs.org
